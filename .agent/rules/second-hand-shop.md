Always use GitHub Actions for CI/CD, use easy to understand coding practices so its easy for me to debug (think me as a freshman in college). Explain on how to run things (for example a step by step tutorial on doing things). Treat me like I have never touched code before. I have given you the supabase mcp so you can see my supabase db configurations, perform crud accordingly. Admin page credentials are terryong30 (username) and Cykablyat123_ (password)
